                        <h2>The top things to see and do in Madagascar</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Madagascar, a country famed for lemurs, baobab trees, birding, and jungles, offers visitors a
                        rich playground to explore. I was enthralled by its beauty: the sweeping canyons and gorges,
                        the grand waterfalls, and the sheer diversity of the landscape. One day you’re in a tropical
                        jungle, the next you’re in an arid plain, and a few hours later you’re in subtropical forest!
                        Plus, there really are seemingly endless varieties of lemurs. Though Madagascar is remote and
                        flights are expensive (more on how to get there and save money in my next post), with only
                        350,000 visitors per year, you get a lot of the country to yourself! (And it’s always better
                        to go to a place sooner rather than later, because you never know where the next “it”
                        destination is going to be!) Though I didn’t get as much time there as I’d like (the roads are
                        terrible — it takes eight hours to go 250km), here are some of the wonders you can expect on
                        your visit:

                        <h2>Avenue of the Baobabs</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Baobab trees are massive trees that can grow 98 feet tall and 36 feet wide and can live up to
                        one thousand years. While there are similar trees in the genus, baobabs are completely unique
                        to Madagascar. They’re an impressive sight, especially when your guide casually mentions that
                        the massive one you’re hugging is just a baby — at 400 years old. While the trees can be found
                        throughout the country, this road lined with them (just an hour outside Morondava) — and
                        straight out of a postcard — is one of those iconic images of Madagascar. The best time for
                        photos is during sunrise or sunset. The worst time for crowds? Those same times. Pick your poison.
