                    <p>
                        Madagascar, a country famed for lemurs, baobab trees, birding, and jungles, offers visitors a
                        rich playground to explore. I was enthralled by its beauty: the sweeping canyons and gorges,
                        the grand waterfalls, and the sheer diversity of the landscape. One day you’re in a tropical
                        jungle, the next you’re in an arid plain, and a few hours later you’re in subtropical forest!
                        Plus, there really are seemingly endless varieties of lemurs. Though Madagascar is remote and
                        flights are expensive (more on how to get there and save money in my next post), with only
                        350,000 visitors per year, you get a lot of the country to yourself! (And it’s always better
                        to go to a place sooner rather than later, because you never know where the next “it”
                        destination is going to be!) Though I didn’t get as much time there as I’d like (the roads are
                        terrible — it takes eight hours to go 250km), here are some of the wonders you can expect on
                        your visit:
